/**
 * One-time migration out of jeep-sqlite's storage.
 *
 * jeep-sqlite kept every database as a whole-file image in a localforage store: IndexedDB
 * database `jeepSqliteStore`, object store `databases`, out-of-line string keys of the form
 * `<name>SQLite.db`, values produced by sql.js's `export()`. This module reads that store with
 * raw IndexedDB (localforage is not a dependency and will not become one), hands every image to
 * the active tier through the same import path a downloaded `.sqlite` file takes, verifies each
 * one with `PRAGMA integrity_check`, and only then retires the legacy store.
 *
 * The rules below were verified against jeep-sqlite 2.8.0 driven in a real browser rather than
 * read off its source, because three of them are invisible in the source:
 *
 * - The legacy IndexedDB database is at **version 2 with two object stores**, `databases` and
 *   `local-forage-detect-blob-support`; localforage adds the second one itself. Opening with an
 *   explicit version 1, which is what jeep's own localforage config asks for, would fail with a
 *   VersionError, so the open here passes no version at all.
 * - A database jeep opened but never saved leaves its key present with an **undefined value**
 *   (`UtilsStore.setInitialDBToStore` stores `null`, which reads back as `undefined`). Those
 *   keys are placeholders for a database that never had any content, not data.
 * - `backup-<name>SQLite.db` keys are written before a version upgrade and removed after it
 *   (jeep `utils/database.js`), so an interrupted upgrade leaves one behind. Importing one would
 *   conjure a phantom database called `backup-<name>`, so it is skipped and a leftover backup
 *   never blocks retiring the legacy store. Only while `<name>SQLite.db` is also present, though:
 *   on its own the key is the sole copy of something, quite possibly a database the app really
 *   did name `backup-...`, and it is then migrated like any other.
 *
 * Failure policy: anything that goes wrong leaves the legacy store exactly as it was and reports
 * a warning. Boot is never blocked, and no legacy byte is deleted until every real database has
 * been imported and has passed its integrity check. The run happens at most once either way: a
 * second attempt would re-import legacy images over databases the app has been writing to since
 * the first, which loses more than it recovers.
